Update: I don't remember when we hold this seminar (should be somewhere in 2012), and put 20130901 as the time.

We'll spend one hour on the following two papers.

 * R. Tron and R. Vidal, "Distributed Computer Vision Algorithms Through Distributed Averaging," IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011.
 * Simon Korman, Shai Avidan, "Coherency Sensitive Hashing, " ICCV, 2011
